# LaySummarization_TFG

## Dataset

The data used for this TFG can be found in the following link: https://github.com/TGoldsack1/Corpora_for_Lay_Summarisation 


## Evaluation

The evaluation models and scrips can be found in the following link: https://github.com/TGoldsack1/BioLaySumm2024-evaluation_scripts. We had to perform two changes in the scripts:
- Change the path to the models to specify our path.
- Comment the evaluation of the results with LENS and BERTScore due to library dependencies problems.
